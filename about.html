        <p>What you see here on your right is me and my girlfriend.<br>
          We met eachother just a little over two years ago and now we
          live together in a small flat in Helsingborg. Our friends often give
          us jibe about our small living quarters but both of us enjoy not
          having unnecessary space to fill just for the <strong>heck</strong> of it.
          <br><br>
          In my spare time I used to be a stronglifter, or at least an aspiring such.
          The last two years I decided to change that however and am now aiming for
          other physical challanges such as Obstacle Course Races (which is quite something
          when you weight 120 kilos) and am also planning on trying gymnastics when I get
          a bit lighter. Pulling 120 kilos is heavy as it is, no need to make it look good
          yet.<br><br>
          The reason I decided to start studying Frontend was a longing for a freedom of
          workplace that I couldn't reach within my back-then career. Our (my girlfriends and mine)
          dream is to be able to work on the road and travel the world while doing it.
          Most people think that we're insane not to follow suit into the get kids, buy a house, work until
          you're sixty-five, and then retire with a devalued retirement fund, but for us the dream is
          <u>out there</u> and this is our way of reaching it.
          <br>
          This remains my prime motivator even when I'm really exhausted, to keep trying to learn more and not
          fall into the trap of "imposter-syndrome" but to be confident that I can do it.
